# Haiyo! Call me Gio 👋

I’m someone who enjoys turning ideas into things that actually *work*. I like breaking systems apart, understanding how the pieces talk to each other, and putting them back together in cleaner, smarter ways. Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time learning, building, and experimenting—always chasing that moment when something finally clicks.
